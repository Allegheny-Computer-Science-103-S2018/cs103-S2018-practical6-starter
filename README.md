# cs103-S2018-lab7-starter

Designed for use with [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/), this
repository contains the starter for Laboratory 7 in Computer Science 103. Since
the Travis builds for this repository will initially fail (as evidenced by a
red &#x2717; appearing in the commit logs instead of a green &#x2714;), the
programmer is responsible for completing all of the steps needed to satisfy the
requirements for the assignment, thus causing a &#x2714; to instead appear in
the commit logs.

## Introduction

This assignment requires a programmer to implement a static web site using the
HTML and CSS programming languages. Specifically, you will leverage a travel
photography web site from a previous assignment that is an extension of the one
in Figure 3.9 of the textbook. As in a past assignment, you add an HTML table
that is styled with another CSS file. Like in your previous assignments, you
will also style the fonts and HTML elements in your web site with a local CSS
file. Next, you will add in an HTML form that surveys the user and reports the
results of the survey to you through an email generated with the
[Formspree](https://formspree.io/) system. Then, you will run a web server to
provide local access to the static web site, specifically loading the default
document, and then complete the survey and check your email for the result.
Finally, you will continue to practice using the
[HTMLHint](http://htmlhint.com/) static analysis code tool that can check HTML
files for potential errors.

The programmer is also responsible for writing a reflection, stored in the file
`writing/reflection.md`, that responds to the questions in the assignment sheet
and explains the challenges that you faced and the solutions you developed.
Please note that this is also a Markdown file that must adhere to the standards
described in the [Markdown Syntax
Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). Remember, you
can preview the contents of a comitted Markdown file by clicking on the name of
the file in your GitHub repository. Finally, don't forget that your
`writing/reflection.md` file and the file mentioned in the previous paragraph
should both adhere to the Markdown standards established by the [Markdown
linting tool](https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint) and the writing
standards set by the [Proselint tool](http://proselint.com/).

The source code in the `index.html` file must also pass additional tests set by
the [GatorGrader tool](https://github.com/gkapfham/gatorgrader). GatorGrader
will check to ensure that your main file contains the required header and that,
for instance, it contains the correct number of `label` tags. Finally,
GatorGrader will check that your `site.css` and `table.css` files contains the
required styling rules. GatorGrader will also ensure that you made the
required number of commits to your repository and that your writing contains
detailed answers to the stated questions. More details about the GatorGrader
checks are included later in this document and in the assignment sheet.

When you use the `git commit` command to transfer your source code to your
GitHub repository, [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/) will initialize a build
of your assignment, checking to see if it meets all of the requirements. If both
your source code and writing meet all of the established requirements, then you
will see a green &#x2714; in the listing of commits in GitHub. If your
submission does not meet the requirements, a red &#x2717; will appear instead.
The instructor will reduce a programmer's grade for this assignment if the red
&#x2717; appears on the last commit in GitHub immediately before the
assignment's due date.

A carefully formatted assignment sheet for this project provides more details
about the steps that a computer scientist should take to complete this
assignment. You can view this assignment sheet by visiting the listing of
laboratories on the course web site.

## Learning

If you have not done so already, please read all of the relevant [GitHub
Guides](https://guides.github.com/) that explain how to use many of the features
that GitHub provides. In particular, please make sure that you have read the
following GitHub guides: [Mastering
Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), [Hello
World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/), and [Documenting Your
Projects on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/). Each of these
guides will help you to understand how to use both [GitHub](http://github.com)
and [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/). Finally, to learn more
about how to include emojis in an HTML file, please read the documentation for
the [Emoji CSS library](https://afeld.github.io/emoji-css/).

To do well on this assignment, you should also review Chapters 1 through 5 of
the course textbook, paying close attention to Sections 5.3 through 5.5 and, for
instance, Figures 5.18, 5.19, and 5.20. Please see the course instructor or one
of the teaching assistants or tutors if you have questions about any of these
reading assignments.

## Commands

To get started in using the GatorGrader tool, you can change into the directory
for this assignment and type the command `./gatorgrader.sh --start` in your
terminal. Now, if you want to perform all of the checks that will
automatically evaluate your assignment, you can type the command
`./gatorgrader.sh --check`. Please note that the GatorGrader tool also runs
the `htmlhint src/www/index.html` command to "lint" your HTML file.

Running this command will produce a lot of output that you should carefully
inspect. If the last line of the output indicates that GatorGrader judges that
there are no mistakes in the assignment, then this means that your source code
and writing are passing all of the automated checks. However, if the last line
of the output indicates that there are mistakes, then you will need to
understand what they are and then try to fix them.

If the course instructor publishes a new version of GatorGrader and asks you to
access it, then you need change into the tool's directory by typing `cd
gatorgrader`. Then, you can type the command `git pull` to download the new
source code for the GatorGrader tool. If this command completes successfully,
then you can return to the main directory for this laboratory assignment by
typing `cd ..` and then continuing your work.

## Checking

In addition to making the checks that were previously mentioned in the
introduction to this document, your final submission must meet the following
requirements.

- The `index.html` file contains the fragment `<title>Travel Survey</title>`.
- The `index.html` file contains the fragment `form action`.
- The `index.html` file contains the fragment `_next`.
- The `index.html` file contains the fragment `_replyto`.
- The `index.html` file contains six of the fragment `<label>`.
- The `index.html` file contains seven of the fragment `radio`.
- The `index.html` file contains five of the fragment `checkbox`.
- The `index.html` file contains the numbers `3` and `80`.
- The `index.html` file contains the fragment `submit`.
- The `index.html` file contains the five of the `em em-` fragment to load an emoji.
- The `index.html` file loads the web fonts from `fonts.googleapis.com`.
- The `index.html` file loads the three required CSS files.
- The `site.css` file specifies `font-family: "Merriweather", serif;` for the
  header font.
- The `site.css` file specifies `font-family: "Montserrat", sans-serif;` for the
  body font.
- The `table.css` file specifies `nth-child` rule two times to control table row
  backgrounds.
- The `table.css` file specifies that the table should `600px` in width.
- The `table.css` file uses the `td:hover` rule to improve user interaction with the
  table.
- The `index.html` file creates a table with a format like the provided
  screenshot.
- The reflection contains four detailed responses to each of the stated
  questions.
- The GitHub repository must contain at minimum five new commits with
  descriptive messages.

The following image gives you an example of the formatting and content that your
final web site should exhibit. Specifically, your web site should display the
provided local image a travel survey, travel tips, and a travel checklist. Make
sure that your web site uses a CSS file that applies all of the styles that you
see in the image at the following link. Please note that you should open this
image in a new browser tab so that you can closely inspect it for the required
features.

## Updates

If the course instructor updates the provided material for this assignment and
you would like to receive these updates, then you can type this command in the
main directory for this assignment:

```
./gatorgrader.sh --update git@github.com:Allegheny-Computer-Science-103-S2018/cs103-S2018-lab7-starter.git
```

You should only need to type this command once; typing the command additional
times may yield an error message but will not negatively influence the state of
your repository. Now, you are ready to download the updates provided by the
course instructor by typing:

```
./gatorgrader.sh --download
```

This second command can be run whenever the course instructor needs to provide
you with new source code for this assignment. However, please note that, if you
have edited the files that the course instructor updated, running the previous
command may lead to Git merge conflicts. If this happens, you may need to
manually resolve them with the help of the instructor or a teaching assistant.

## Travis

This assignment uses [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/) to automatically run
the checking programs every time you commit to your GitHub repository. The
checking will start as soon as you have accepted the assignment, thus creating
your own private repository, and the course instructor enables Travis for it. If
you are using Travis for the first time, you will need to authorize Travis CI to
access the private repositories that you created on GitHub.

## Requirements

The GatorGrader software that supports the checking of this assignment was
developed for the following software and versions:

- mdl 0.4.0
- proselint 0.7.0
- python 3.5.2
